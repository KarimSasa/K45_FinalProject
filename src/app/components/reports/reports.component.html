        According to Gartner's analysis, the adoption of multimodal generative AI solutions is expected to see dramatic growth over the next few years. From a mere 1% of generative AI solutions being multimodal in 2023, predictions indicate a substantial increase to 40% by 2027. This forty-fold increase represents a significant shift in the AI landscape.

        This trend reflects the growing capability of AI systems to process and generate content across various modalities simultaneously, including text, images, videos, and audio. The projected growth underscores the increasing importance of multimodal capabilities in edge-based AI applications, particularly in scenarios requiring real-time processing and diverse data type handling.
